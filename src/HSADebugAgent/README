These files implement a HSA Agent to work with rocm-gdb

The libAMDHSADebugAgent-x64.so is built and injected into the running application by the ROCR runtime.
The location and filename for HSADebugAgent.so is passed using HSA_TOOLS_LIB environment variable.

Build the agent library with HwDbg DBE.

Once you have compiled the agent library, dont forget to add the DBE path your LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
since it is a dynamic library


The Agent can only be used when the application is run within rocm-gdb
The rocmConfigure in the gdbinit file sets the appropriate environment variables

GDBInit:
The contents of the gdbinit file located within the Agent directory should be appended to the .gdbinit to your home directory
Once you start gdb, you should run: rocmconfigure.

The command rocmconfigure can be added within the init file to always set up gdb for rocm.
